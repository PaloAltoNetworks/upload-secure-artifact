# Upload Artifact Secure

This GitHub Action scans artifacts for secrets using [truffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog) before uploading them. The upload functionality is done by wrapping the original [upload-artifact](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) GitHub action, ensuring that no sensitive information is included in the uploaded artifacts.

## Features

- Compatible with upload-artifact v4
- Alerts users if any secrets are detected
- Prevents uploading artifacts if secrets are found
- Wraps around the `upload-artifact` GitHub action for seamless integration
